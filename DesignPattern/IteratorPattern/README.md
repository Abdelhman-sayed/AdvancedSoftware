# Iterator Design Pattern

## definition:

The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## when to use?

Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation(that mean without ever getting a peek at how you store your objects).

## Some notes about this pattern:

-- An Iterator allows access to an aggregateâ€™s elements without exposing its internal structure.<br>
-- An Iterator takes the job of iterating over an aggregate and encapsulates it in another
object.<br>
-- When using an Iterator, we relieve the aggregate of the responsibility of supporting operations for traversing its data.<br>
-- An Iterator provides a common interface for traversing the items of an aggregate, allowing you to use polymorphism when writing code that makes use of the items of the aggregate.<br>
-- We should strive to assign only one responsibility to each class.<br>

## And we have two types of iterators:

### Internal Iterator:

An internal iterator is controlled
by the iterator itself.

### External Iterator:

An external iterator which means that the client controls the
iteration by calling next() to get the next
element.

### So Internal iterators are less flexible that external iterators.

## Let's take an example() about the Iterator pattern:

### The details About this example:

1. We have an iterator interface that has methods that help me during iteration, like hasNext() and next().<br>
2. For every new type of iterator, we must implement the iterator interface, such as DinerMenuIterator (which iterates over an array) and PancakeHouseMenuIterator (which iterates over an ArrayList).<br>
3. And we have a Menu interface that has a createIterator method that returns a MyIterator pattern. So, for every new menu, we will add a new iterator.<br>
4. And we have a class MenuItem that contains details(price, name, description and vegetarian) about any item on the menu.<br>
5. In the class waitress, we take a specific menu and create an iterator of this menu type. To understand more, look at this code.<br>

6. And any structure you use to create a new menu will be an instance of the MenuItem class.
